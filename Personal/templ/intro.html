					<p  style="margin-right: 10%; margin-left: 5%;">An inspiring software developer living currently in the Pittsburgh region.  I enjoy working on personal projects to satisfy my nerdy hobbies and passions.  I work with kids at the Sarah Heinz House on the North side where I have the privlige of co-running their robotics programs for preschooelrs, to high schoolers.  My various interests outside of programming is biking, climbing, video games, and cooking.

					<p style="margin-right: 10%; margin-left: 5%;">
					My belief is that software is made to make life easier for the end user; so whether it be the smallest conveinece of automating a task, or using software to assist learning and problem solving in our youth, my goal is to improve the quality of life of any person that may use my projects.
